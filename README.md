SimpleClock - a simple always-on-top desktop clock written using nw.js


### What is this repository for? ###

* An exercise in getting to know nw.js

### How do I get set up? ###

  Zip up the contents of this directory into a .zip file and rename the file, changing its extension to .nw say
  'simpleclock.nw'

  Next, you need to have nw.exe installed on your machine.
  You may [download it from here](https://nwjs.io/downloads/)

  [TODO: build an installer that bundles nw.js]

  Run it as follows -
  "C:\Program Files\nwjs-sdk-v0.13.0-rc1-win-x64\nw.exe" --force-cpu-redraw --disable-gpu "C:\work\simpleclock.nw"

  (note: This stuff was written sometime in 2015-2016 and is being used with nwjs v0.13)

### Acknowledgement ###
The font used is [DS-DIGITAL](http://www.dafont.com/ds-digital.font) by Dusit Supasawat and the copyright remains with him.

The font is shareware and if you like the font, you may send payment to Dusit as given in the file DIGITAL.TXT
However, the email address mentioned in that file is bouncing, so we only have a snail mail postal address. The license
mentions that "so long as this text file (DIGITAL.txt) is distributed with the archive, the font files have not
 been modified" we are free to distribute the archive. A liberty I have taken is to convert (not modify) the ttf files to web
 fonts so that they can be used in a web app using
 [FontSquirrels webfont generator](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator).
